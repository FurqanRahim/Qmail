                We are digital workers like you
            </h2>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                Are you a student, a freelancer, or an entrepreneur? Are you running a business or working for one? Are you working remote, or in an office?
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                Whatever the answer, right now, you have tabs open – documents in progress, sites you’ve visited. You have your inbox, maybe you keep notes on paper, or in an app. You have a to-do list, a calendar.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                If so, you’re the same as us – how do you stay on top of everything?
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                We ran a thought experiment – what if you could just take your pick of what mattered to you, across all those touchpoints? One click to capture the place and the thought.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                That’s where we started
            </p>

            {/* Section 2 */}
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-[#2F206A] text-center">
                Everybody wants your attention
            </h2>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                We have a problem to solve – every app we use and resource we visit lives in a domain, and each competes for our attention. To get control over them, our app needed to live inside the browser itself. A full-size application squeezed into an extension.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                So we built it and things went a little crazy
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                Some were using it to leave hilarious notes on random web pages, some to share YouTube videos. Some to highlight a social post, or a new toilet seat on Amazon. How do we know? Because we were sharing them with each other.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                And the questions started: Was Insite a social tool? A messaging platform? The ultimate to-do list? A replacement for bookmarks? The list went on – but one thing we all agreed on: it was empowering.
            </p>

            {/* Section 3 */}
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-black text-[#2F206A] text-center">
                We're here to put you in control
            </h2>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                If the idea was to put the user in the driving seat, what did that say about how our app should be designed? Everything was on the table: what should Insite do – and (more importantly) what should it not do? We researched the competition and the truth is they all do what they do very well.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                We had email, we had a project management system and messaging tools. And we were using Insite for everything in between as we tried to figure out what it was.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                And the shape of Insite began to emerge on its own
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                Insite seemed to thrive in the space other applications left between them. It wasn’t trying to rival them – it was simply joining the dots between them.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                Installed in the browser, Insite sits above all the noise and chaos. We didn’t want to add to that. If anything, we wanted to help people make sense of it all. Maybe give them the space to pull their thoughts together, think and reflect. And then act when they are ready.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                The answer had been staring at us all along
            </p>

            {/* Section 4 */}
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-[#2F206A] text-center">
                Next steps in this journey
            </h2>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                Marketing people always ask if your product is a vitamin or a painkiller – does it have a feel-good factor or does it address a pain-point? We see Insite as more of a personal superpower, something you don't know you need until you try it. If messaging platforms are like handing everyone a whistle, and a project management system like trying to conduct an orchestra, maybe Insite turns you into a musician, free to play what you choose.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-bold">
                At heart, Insite is simple and also countercultural
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                Maybe the world, drowning in notifications, toolsets and AI hype, needs a product that leverages our minds – rather than trying to overwhelm and dominate us.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                We know we have a lot of work ahead – continuing to evolve Insite in a way that focuses on you, not extended feature lists. The harder part is figuring out how we get noticed in this noisy world. And we are excited by that.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
                We built this product for ourselves and we are building this product for you – all of us digital workers, sitting in front of our screens, with all those tabs open, trying to do our best.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-black text-[#2F206A] text-center">
